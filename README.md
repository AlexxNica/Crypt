Crypt
=====

OSX desktop encryption app implemented as UI a wrapper around OpenSSL. 

All encryption and folder archiving are done by running a task which calls a command line scriptwithin the app wrapper  (crypt3.sh) which uses tar, gzip and openssl.

I sold this app for a number of years but after reading about the unethical and criminal spying activities being done by various governments, I've decided to make the it free and open source.
